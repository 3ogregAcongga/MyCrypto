## Step 2: Create a Decision Model for FIFA --
 
The next step is to create a decision model for FIFA -- using Expert Choice 11.5. A decision model is a graphical representation of your decision problem, which consists of a goal, criteria, and alternatives.

To create a decision model for FIFA --, open Expert Choice 11.5 and click on "New" from the menu bar. You will see a blank workspace where you can drag and drop elements from the toolbar. Start by adding a goal node and naming it "Win FIFA -- Tournament". Then add criteria nodes and name them according to your preferences. For example, you can name them "Player Skills", "Team Tactics", "Opponent Difficulty", etc. You can also add sub-criteria nodes if you want to break down your criteria into more specific aspects.
 
Next, add alternative nodes and name them according to your options. For example, you can name them "Real Madrid", "Barcelona", "Manchester United", etc. You can also add sub-alternative nodes if you want to compare individual players instead of teams.
 
Finally, connect the nodes with arrows to indicate the relationships between them. The arrows should point from the goal node to the criteria nodes, and from the criteria nodes to the alternative nodes. You can also adjust the weights of the arrows by dragging them or using the slider bar at the bottom of the screen.
 
## Step 3: Enter Your Preferences and Criteria

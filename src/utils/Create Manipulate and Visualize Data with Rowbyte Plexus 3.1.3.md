One of the most powerful features of Rowbyte Plexus 3.1.3 is the ability to use expressions to control the parameters of the particles. You can use simple math expressions or complex JavaScript code to create dynamic and responsive animations. You can also link the expressions to other layers, effects or external data sources.
 
Another feature that sets Rowbyte Plexus 3.1.3 apart from other particle plugins is the integration with Cinema 4D. You can import C4D files directly into After Effects and use them as Plexus objects. You can also export Plexus objects as C4D files and use them in Cinema 4D with full compatibility.
 
Rowbyte Plexus 3.1.3 also comes with a rich set of presets and tutorials that can help you get started quickly and easily.

If you are wondering how Rowbyte Plexus 3.1.3 compares to other particle plugins, you might be interested to know that it has some unique advantages. For example, Rowbyte Plexus 3.1.3 does not use the native After Effects particle system, which means it can handle much more particles and render them faster. It also has a custom OpenGL renderer that can utilize the GPU power and deliver high-quality results.
 
Another advantage of Rowbyte Plexus 3.1.3 is the flexibility and customization it offers. You can create your own custom objects and use them as Plexus primitives. You can also use any layer as a mask or a matte for the Plexus objects. You can also apply any effect or adjustment layer to the Plexus layer and achieve amazing results.
